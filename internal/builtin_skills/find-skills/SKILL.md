## Quick Start

### List Installed Skills

```bash
goclaw skills list
goclaw skills list --verbose  # Show detailed info including content
```

### Install from URL

```bash
# From Git repository
goclaw skills install https://github.com/user/skill-repo

# From local path
goclaw skills install ./path/to/skill
```

### Validate Skills

```bash
# Check if skill dependencies are satisfied
goclaw skills validate skill-name
```

### Test Skills

```bash
# Test a skill with a prompt
goclaw skills test skill-name --prompt "your test prompt here"
```

---

## Skill Locations

Skills are stored in a unified location:

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `~/.goclaw/skills` | All skills (user-installed and built-in) |

Built-in skills are automatically copied to this directory on first run.

---

## Installing Skills

### From Git Repository

```bash
# Basic installation
goclaw skills install https://github.com/user/repo

# The skill will be installed to ~/.goclaw/skills/<repo-name>
```

### From Local Path

```bash
# From a directory containing SKILL.md
goclaw skills install /path/to/skill
```

### Updating Skills

```bash
# Update a specific skill (must be a Git repo)
goclaw skills update skill-name
```

### Uninstalling Skills

```bash
# Remove a skill
goclaw skills uninstall skill-name
```

---

## Finding Relevant Skills

### 1. Search Built-in Skills

Use `goclaw skills list` to see what's available:

```bash
goclaw skills list --verbose
```

### 2. Browse External Sources

**Official goclaw skills:** Check the project repository for bundled skills.

**Community sources:**
- GitHub: Search for `goclaw skill` or `agent skill`
- Skills compatible with OpenClaw/Agent Skills format can often be adapted

### 3. Check Skill Metadata

Each skill has a `description` field in its YAML frontmatter that indicates when it should be used:

```yaml
---
name: crawl4ai
description: This skill should be used when users need to scrape websites,
extract structured data, handle JavaScript-heavy pages, or build automated
web data pipelines.
---
```

---

## Creating Custom Skills

If no existing skill meets your needs, create one:

### Initialize New Skill

```bash
cd ~/.goclaw/skills
mkdir my-skill
cd my-skill

# Create SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
```

### SKILL.md Template

```markdown

3. **Test skills** - Use `goclaw skills test <name>` to verify behavior
4. **Keep skills lean** - Skills should be concise and focused
5. **Use references** - Move detailed docs to `references/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not found

ls -la ~/.goclaw/skills/

# Verify skill has SKILL.md
ls ~/.goclaw/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# Validate to see what's missing
goclaw skills validate <skill-name>

# Install missing binaries or set environment variables
```

### Skill not loading

```bash
# Check skill format is valid
cat ~/.goclaw/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md

# YAML frontmatter must start with `---`
# and have a name and description field
```
